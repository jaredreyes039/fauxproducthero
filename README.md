Hero page for fake software product announcing a dealing.


# Welcome to Hyperdrive: The Future of Software Development

## Goal

This is merely a hero page for a faux product dubbed 'Hyperdrive.' An experiment in three.js and OrbitControls.js,
this project, though somewhat basic in appearance, was a challenge to deduce and thus this is one of my favorite
projects for the contrast in difficulty developing to simplicity in displaying.

## Project Highlights

- Utilization of three.js and OrbitControls.js to develop a 3D animated scene using a recursive animation loop
- Generation of random objects in random positions with random dimensions (say that 3x fast!)
- Implementation of TypeIt.js for a functional typing animation

## Problems & Solutions

- Problem: More objects or restart space transition?
  - Solution: Have the scene transition from z position relative to camera position to avoid memory leaks from object overloading!
